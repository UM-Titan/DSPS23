# DSPS23

## Data Science for Pavements Symposium (DSPS)

This is the second DSPS student competition on the application of AI for pavement condition monitoring. Similar to the first edition of DSPS, the competition will follow a data-centric model instead of the traditional model-centric approaches. Top-down and dash-cam views of pavement image data containing 7 main distress types and their corresponding severities annotated with bounding boxes will be provided. Participants will systematically change/enhance datasets provided using various data cleaning, annotation, augmentation strategies to improve the accuracy of a predefined model architecture.
