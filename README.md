# DSPS23

## Data Science for Pavements Symposium (DSPS)

This is the second DSPS student competition on the application of AI for pavement condition monitoring. Similar to the first edition of DSPS, the competition will follow a data-centric model instead of the traditional model-centric approaches. Top-down and dash-cam views of pavement image data containing 7 main distress types and their corresponding severities annotated with bounding boxes will be provided. Participants will systematically change/enhance datasets provided using various data cleaning, annotation, augmentation strategies to improve the accuracy of a predefined model architecture.

## <summary> RULES </summary>
We expect you to respect the spirit of the competition and do not cheat.
* There is no restriction on the size of the team.
* The use of external data is forbidden
* Pre-trained models other than the ones provided are not allowed in the competition
* Teams must only use the algorithm/model selected by the organizers. 
* Please submit source code and trained model before the deadline. IPython Notebook is desirable for the source code submission. The organizers will verify the reproducibility of the algorithm before determining the final winner.
